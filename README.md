# minecraft-fly-plugin
This plugin registers the /fly command, which toggles the flying state of the player who executed the command. If the player is already flying, the command disables flying. If the player is not flying, the command enables flying.

To use this plugin, you'll need to compile it into a JAR file and place it in the plugins folder of your Minecraft server. You can then start or reload your server to load the plugin.

Please note that allowing players to fly can have gameplay implications and should be used carefully in multiplayer servers.

# Note
This is my first minecraft plugin so its pretty bad i suggest you tu use Fly (https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/simpleflymod)
